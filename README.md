# NodeJS GBA online
Manual fork of jsemu/gba without the roms

This is a NodeJS version of [jsemu](https://github.com/jsemu/gba) github pages. Which is based on a 
JavaScript GameBoy Advance Emulator called [IodineGBA](https://github.com/taisel/IodineGBA), if you wanna check it out.

I removed the ROMS and the BIOS for size purposes, if you want to download and try it out create a `resources/games`
fodler in the root of this application and the BIOS in `resources`

You can create your own configuration under `user_scripts`
